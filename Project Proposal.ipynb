    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Pneumonia is a severe yet common respiratory disease that affects millions of people all over the world and causes many deaths, mainly in developing countries. Early diagnosis and timely detection of the disease using chest X-ray images can help in improving the outcomes of the treatment strategies and save lives. Diagnosis from X-rays requires expertise in the subject and is rather time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following project relates to the automatic detection of pneumonia using machine learning techniques, specifically deep learning algorithms. It shall delve into the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, which always perform very well in image classification tasks. The dataset contains chest X-ray images labeled as \"Pneumonia\" and \"Normal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I will proceed with transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet50 and VGG16, which will help achieve high accuracy for classification. The performance evaluation metrics to be used in assessing the effectiveness of the models are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms and Tools\n",
    "- **Dataset**: Chest X-Ray Images (e.g., Kaggle Pneumonia Dataset).\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: Deep Learning with CNNs (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16).\n",
    "- **Tools**: Google collab(Notebook) , TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn for model building and evaluation.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Grad-CAM will be used to highlight regions in X-rays that contribute to predictions.\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect the model to achieve an accuracy above 90% on the test dataset, using transfer learning for faster and improved performance. I believe that Grad-CAM will provide meaningful visualizations to ensure Clear predictions.\n",
    "Potential challenges include:\n",
    "- Addressing class imbalance in the dataset.\n",
    "- Optimizing hyperparameters and tuning for improved model accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, I aim to learn the following:\n",
    "- Implementation of CNNs for medical image classification.\n",
    "- The impact of transfer learning in reducing training time and improving accuracy.\n",
    "- Methods to evaluate and interpret deep learning models using visualizations.\n",
    "The most difficult aspect of the project will likely be overcoming class imbalance and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.\n",
